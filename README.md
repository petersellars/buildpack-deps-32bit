# buildpack-deps-32bit

This repository contains 32bit based ports of the official [buildpack-deps](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/buildpack-deps)

It leverages a 32bit Ubuntu base image [cato1971/ubuntu](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/cato1971/ubuntu)

Currently it only contains the jesse-curl implementation as that is all I needed at this time!
